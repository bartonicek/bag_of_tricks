# Handy Algorithms

This is a repo for a kind of personal handbook of short statistical programming algorithms/tricks/methods that I found useful at some time or another. The main goal is to provide a conceptual reference for future me on:

  a) what statistical computing problems I have encountered in the past
  b) how to solve them
  
For this reason, each included piece of code may not be the most efficient/elegant solutions to a given problem. Instead, the code is supposed to strike balance between legibility and length, and may be close to pseudo-code. 

Most of the code will be in R, unless I decide otherwise.
